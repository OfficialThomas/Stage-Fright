Our creative tilt:

By making the player's actions to survive the infinite runner determine the purcussion of the song, the game is more dynamic as players can generate their own creative beat. This is connnected to the fact that in play.js, the punch and kick buttons are where the sound for the purcussion plays. This means that the player can use the slower notes at the start to have a bit of fun while begining to understand the game's inputs before they even hit an enemy.

On top of that, we made it a constraint to limit the player to two keys of input. This allows the player to understand what buttons they need to press by simply reading the start menu. These keys were also chosen because on English keyboards, these are the two keys with indents. This means that someone that may type on a keyboard a lot but does not really play games will have an easier experience learning the inputs compared to other games.
